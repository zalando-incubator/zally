### Zally - Zalando's API Linter loves you

Minimalistic API linter of awesomeness, bringing order to a sea of APIs.

- Ensures API definitions conform to
[our standard REST guidelines](http://zalando.github.io/restful-api-guidelines/).
- Does not require a deployed service, only an API definition.
- Accepts [swagger](https://swagger.io) yaml and json formats.
- Easy-to-use [CLI](cli/README.md) allows you to check your API *right now*.
- [Web UI](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/zally-web-ui) provides an intuitive web interface with tons of features.

### Core Technical Concepts

- Parses swagger files using [swagger-parser](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-parser)
- Written in Java 8 with [Spring Boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot)
- Zally comes with a server which lints your swagger files
- Zally CLI is handy command-line tool, it uses the server in the background
- Zally Web UI is another client build on top of React and Node.js
- Rule changes only have to be applied in the server component

**Tech Stack:** Zally server is written in Java 8 with Spring Boot. We made rule implementation
optional possible in Kotlin. API-specific code remains in Java 8 due to better integration with
Spring Boot. Further details can be found [here](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/zally/pull/65#issuecomment-269474831).
With Spring 5 we consider using Kotlin also on API side directly. Stay tuned.


### Dependencies

- Java 8


### Installation and Usage

You can find installation steps in the [Server Readme](server/README.md), [CLI Readme](cli/README.md) and [Web UI Readme](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/zally-web-ui/blob/master/README.md).

If you just wanna try it out: first run the server locally, then just use the cli tool as it is provided.


### Roadmap

For [version 1.1](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/zally/milestone/1) we focus on these three main areas:

- improve rule implementations
- improve CLI user experience
- improve web UI
- use better integration testing approaches

Feel free to contribute on related issues for version 1.1.

Afterwards we focus on Github integration and more sophisticated features.

### Quick start guide

```bash
git clone git@github.com:zalando-incubator/zally.git zally
cd zally

# Disable authentication and start a local version of Zally server
cd server
echo "spring.profiles.active=dev" >> application.properties
./gradlew clean build
./gradlew bootRun > /dev/null &
cd ..

# Build and run Zally CLI
cd cli/
./gradlew clean build
bin/zally /path/to/swagger/definition.yaml
```
